## About
This public repository is my portfolio website written in pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It took me longer to decide on the design than it was for me to program it and I'm sure there will be changes in the future. 

The goal for this site is to showcase my software engineering works while making the user feel like they're using an app. This website does not have dynamic content as the selected project cards are simple and limited to 5 due to my goal.

This website is targeted for recruiters with the goal to get straight to the point in showcasing my projects.

## Features

1. Light and dark mode automatically switches dependent on local time of client. 
2. On scroll transitions using Gsap javascript library.
3. Interactive mouse on hover effect.
